## Task 0: Git Basics

I liked a lot Udemy git course. Especially materials about pull-request and branching was useful for me.
And, here is my answers to three questions, which was listed in general requirements:

- Materials about about conflicts, branches and merging was new for me.

- I was suprised, that is the thing like staging area exists in git. Also, the thing about octopus was surprising me too.

- I totally will use all the things, that i learned during the course. But right now, i will use knowledge about pull-requests.
